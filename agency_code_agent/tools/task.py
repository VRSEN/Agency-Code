    Launch a new agent that has access to the following tools: Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, exit_plan_mode, Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookRead, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch.
    
    When to use the Agent tool:
    - If you are searching for a keyword like "config" or "logger", or for questions like "which file does X?"
    - Open-ended searches that may require multiple rounds of searching
    
    When NOT to use:
    - Reading specific file paths (use Read or Glob instead)
    - Searching for specific class definitions (use Glob instead)
    - Writing code and running bash commands
