# Agency Code Demo

Demo tasks for testing coding agent capabilities.

## The Demo

**File**: `messy_snake.py`
**Prompt**:
```
This Snake game works but it's a complete mess - everything is in one giant function.
Can you analyze it and refactor it into clean, professional code?
```

## What It Shows

- **Code analysis** - Reads and understands messy code
- **Strategic planning** - Creates refactoring plan with TodoWrite
- **Tool coordination** - Uses Read â†’ Edit/MultiEdit systematically
- **Clean architecture** - Transforms into proper OOP structure

## Additional Demo Ideas

**Task 2: Debug Challenge**
```
Create a simple calculator with intentional bugs, then debug and fix them using tests.
```

**Task 3: Feature Addition**
```
Build a basic text-based todo app, then add file persistence and priority levels.
```

## Run

```bash
python agency.py
```
